He doesn't care if I take his toys away because he knows I'll give them back at some point. He only gets aggressive when his accomplishments are destroyed or cleaned up..... His accomplishments include any hole he's dug, anything he's ripped into a million pieces ( like a piece of cardboard or one of his doggie bags I let him rip up).When I fill up a hole he's dug by pushing dirt back into the hole with my boot , he becomes infuriated, barking, trying to move  my foot with his mouth ( not biting ,more like clamping , not quick like a bite , more like he will grab  on and try to pull ) When I clean up the mess he's made tearing up cardboard or doggy bags, he barks , growls, jumps around making sure he's made me understand he isn't pleased....recently he tore up the inside of a stuffed toy into a pile of stuffing , took him at least 30 minutes. When I went to clean the pile up, he snapped at me ! He actually got a piece of my hand. Barely broke the skin but it could have been much worse. Needless to say I was shocked. Then I got pissed. Yelled NO and immediately put him into his kennel while I cleaned up the mess and then 30 more minutes for good measure. I didn't know how to react to what he did because none of my other dogs has ever done anything similar and he hasn't ever been aggressive towards me in the 6 years I've had him. Right after her got me he seemed almost as stunned as I did. Then again it could have just been me being anthropomorphic..... It's not exactly resource guarding because he doesn't care if I pick up his toys or his food. It only seems to me that he becomes enraged when I  \"undo\" what he has put time and effort into doing.
