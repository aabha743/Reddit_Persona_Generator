I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  \n\\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  \n\\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT\n\nI see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead",

Or lasik although that's a bit pricy (and scary to some). I did it and was the best decision ever.\n\n  \n**Work out -** \n\nmake sure to get enough protein and look into creatine as well\n\nI'd recommend losing weight though cardio & eating healthier, as well as build muscle though bench and squats. Don't forget to stretch too since you can injure yourself! And get a gym rat to spot you. Once you start losing weight you'll see your face slim down as well\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3QVQJ9/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3QVQJ9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULZF5HC/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULZF5HC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n\n  \n**Fashion -** \n\nUniqlo is a good start, but you gotta dress well in Uniqlo\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C\\_oENHCPkft](https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C_oENHCPkft)\n\n(If you're in Japan just buy them there it's cheaper haha)\n\nI wouldn't recommend you wearing anime related items if you're trying to be \"conventionally attractive\". Make it something very subtle, like a tiny totoro tattoo on your wrist, or a ring which doesn't shout ANIMEEEEE! Also if someone asks your about it you can elaborate on your interest, but keep it short and succinct so you don't nerd out until you know they are interested in learning more.\n\nIf you can afford it, go one layer above and try Cos\n\n[https://www.cos.com/en\\_usd/men.html](https://www.cos.com/en_usd/men.html)\n\n\n\n**Eyebrows** **-** \n\nGo get your brows done at an Indian threading place.

If you're worried about balding there's these crazy services in Turkey where they will regrow your hair (example below).

That\u2019s game changing if you are pushing for religion (which honestly you should unless there are reasons not to).\u00a0\n\nThe great scientist points are great to have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running.\n\nI usually play at deity where the AI starts miles ahead in technology so don\u2019t even bother, but if you\u2019re playing king or emperor it should be a decent strat.",

They surveyed the island, took biological records of the wildlife, and to an extent modernized Taiwan. I was surprised to see how a sizable portion of Taiwan\u2019s natural history museum were contributions by Japanese scientists when I went to Taipei.\n\nHowever, I think it\u2019s about how people in Taiwan perceive Japanese occupation which is relevant. This actually isn\u2019t entirely about what Japan did in Taiwan, but what came after. The kuomintang led nationalist government committed mass murder (known as the 228 incident), which made those who lived through both eras look back fondly at the era of Japanese occupation.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to justify colonialism, but feel that the atrocities by the nationalism government seems to have painted a (relatively) positive light of the Japanese occupation in the eyes of the elders.\u00a0\n\nI am curious to hear a Taiwanese persons\u2019 perspective on this though, because my understanding is that the occupying japanese forces also did their fair share of inhumane acts during the occupation.",

If you're putting up Japanese artwork as art and is respecting it, I doubt any Japanese person will take offense. But making some cheap piece of clothing and branding it as \"kimono\" since it will sell better is disrespectful in my eyes.\n\nI think the keyword here is \"authenticity\" and \"respect\". As long as one adopts a culture with these in mind, there is nothing wrong with it. But it's ultimately up to those who belong in the original culture to decide if these standards are being met. Obviously there is no \"singular hive mind of Japanese consciousness\", and the answer will depend from person to person. \n\nAs Japan becomes more racially/culturally diverse (albeit slower than most other nations), these definitions will shift. A Ukrainian born woman (ethnically entirely white European) just became Ms. Japan, which led to alot of backlash. Personally I think this is a welcoming change as Japan embraces diversity, especially as she is much more culturally Japanese than most ethnically Japanese people. I feel Japan should redefine what it means to be Japanese, and cultural symbols like her or Osaka Naomi, Rui Hachimura, are pushing the envelope in a positive way.\n\n\n\nAnd to answer your question:\n\nTraditionally (pre industrial revolution) kimonos were worn by people of different social class for a variety of occasions. Kimono actually means \"clothes\", which includes sub categories such as samui (work clothes) or yukata (summer clothes). There's also a word for western clothes (\u6d0b\u670d), which is what most people wear these days.\n\nIn modern era, there are certain occasions you are more likely to see it (e.g. summer festivals, tea ceremony, black tie events), but it's not uncommon to see people wearing kimono on the streets any time of the year. \n\nMaybe it's worth having a conversation with your daughter-in-law to get her perspective on it.",

Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. \nNew York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.",

I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it\u2019s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much\u2026\n\nAlso where\u2019s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a \u201cwork device\u201d, they gotta have at least Xcode right?\n\nI can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can\u2019t replace my entire workflow, I don\u2019t know if I can justify the price. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you\u2019d like to see ASAP.",

Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.\n\n**Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?**\n\nI feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.\n\nThe current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.\n\nThe first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/) has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)\n\nPlease let me know what you think!\n\nIndividual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.",

But is there a way to better understand what we get our \"gratification\" from, and track this?\n\nMy initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the \"gratification\" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase.\n\nOf course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases. Some things (rent, insurance, etc.) do not yield any gratification scores, but many purchases (clothes, going out, etc.) could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould love to hear how you make your purchase decisions, and if there's a mental model you follow!\n\n(photo is a mockup of the idea I'm working on)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7dzy8gi0jib1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=803a36d08e4dce445fef0c9b07bbf9a3a1ab97a4",
